        <h2>What is Guava Duff?</h2>
        <p>A warm and soft dessert filled with hand picked guava's. </p>
        <p>Topped with a guava rum sauce.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>Fresh Guavas</li>
            <li>Cinnamon</li>
            <li>Flour</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Milk</li>
            <li>Butter</li>
            <li>Boiling water</li>
            <li>Rum</li>
            <li>Sugar</li>
            <li>Ground Allspice</li>
            <li>Baking Powder</li>
            <li>Shorting</li>
            <li>Egg</li>
            <li>Icing Sugar</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            
        </ul>

        <h2>Bring it together!!</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Peel, seed, and dice the guavas. Strain, reserving the juice.</li>

            <ul>

                <li>Place the guava in a saucepan with enough water to cover completely.</li>
                <li> Add the sugar, cinnamon, and allspice. Bring to a simmer and simmer until the guava is soft.</li>
                <li> (If you are using guava jam, canned guavas or pulp, skip this step, but mix in cinnamon and allspice.</li>
                <li> Add sugar to taste, but you won’t need much if you’re using jam.)</li>
            </ul> 

            <h3>Dough</h3>
            <li>In a large bowl combine the flour, baking powder and salt and stir well.</li>

            <ul>
                <li> Mix in the shortening.</li> 
                <li>Add the milk and egg and mix well to form a soft dough. Knead until smooth.</li>
                <li>Roll out the dough on a floured board,</li>
                <li>Spoon on the cooled and cooked guava and spread evenly. Roll up the dough carefully into a log with a guava spiral. Seal the edges to prevent the filling from coming out during cooking.</li>
                <li>Wrap the dough in several layers or baking or parchment paper. Add at least two layers of foil and tie tightly with kitchen twine. Place in a large pot of boiling water. Boil for about 1 hour. Make sure the dish is large enough for the wrapped duff to fit comfortably, as it will swell during cooking.

                    <p>After it is cooked, allow it to cool down to comfortably warm before cutting it into about 1″ thick slices.</p>
                
                    <p><strong><em>Serve with</em></strong> rum sauce!</p></li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Butter rum sauce</h3>

            <li>Cream the butter until soft</li>

            <ul>
                <li>Gradually beat in the icing sugar.</li>
                <li>Add the boiling water, salt, and rum and beat until smooth and fluffy.</li>
            </ul>
            
                  
        </ol>
